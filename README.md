# Flames

There is an intersting things which used to happened during my school time. We used a game to find out the relationship with others using by names, that was really funny.

That game will be done using the following ways.

-> Write down your name on a paper
-> Write down your partner name below your name 
-> Remove the common letter from those two names only once. 

For example,

Let's say the names as
  Brat
  Angelina
  
  Take out B from the 'Brat' and compare with Angelina to find out does 'B' available in Angelina. No..So move on to next letter...and so on. 
  When a from Brat is taken to process, we will have result as 'Brt' and 'ngelina'. And this will be result of these two names after removal of common lettes.
  
  -> Count the letters on both the names after the removal of common letters on the two names.
  
  In our case, 'Brt' and 'ngelina' have the 10 letters.
  
  -> And then do the proces as in below
  
  Take the String 'FLAMES'
  Now starts counting from 1 to 10 on the String 'FLAMES', as F-1, L-2, A -3 , M-4, E - 5, S-6 and then again from starting, F-7,L-8, A -9 , M-10.
  
  Since the count 10 is on M, just remove 'M' from 'FLAMES'. So the String for next process 'FLAES'
  Now starts counting from 1 to 10 on the String 'FLAES', as F-1, L-2, A -3 ,  E - 4, S-5 and then again from starting, F-6,L-7, A -8 , E-10, S-10. 
  Since the count 10 is on S, just remove 'M' from 'FLAES'. So the String for next process 'FLAE'.
  
  Do the same process until just only one letter remains.
  In our case we wil have finally 'A'.
  
  Then just map the remained letter by using the below constants and make fun
  F - Freindship
  L - Lovers
  A- Affection
  M - Marriage
  E - Enemy
  S- Sister.
  
  Funny...
